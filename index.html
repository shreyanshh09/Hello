It might be they watched somebody who inspires them to do something that never done before and I am one of those people. I love Cricket so much since I watched Virat Kohli on a TV. He is an Indian cricket player and very famous for his talent and skills of competition which are reasons for me want to be like him. I disliked exercising very much I had never thought that sports were very exciting. I wasn't interested in any sports.</p1> 
        <br>
        <br>    
        <p2> I was very an inert person and didn't prepare to study, do activities with cousins, or the challenging things until I had seen the fierce Cricket game that Virat Kohli played. 
             I felt enjoyable and wanted to play, the same time I really admired his talent, skills and body movement which are the
             important things for me or can say another way that I want to change myself form an inert person into an enthusiastic person.</font>

Most of the time, many players cannot perform well in international cricket and the main cause of this failure is nothing but lack of self-confidence. While these players have performed well nationally, yes the pressure in international cricket is always different and you can only achieve success in this format if you have enough confidence in yourself.

            According to Virat Kohli, believing in yourself is always limited and it is a positive impurity that always prompts you to give your best in the field and then no one can stop you from being successful.

His team mates needed him at a crucial moment when he was much more needed at home. He preferred to do his duty and scored 90 runs. That was an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial.Virat Kohli shot into prominence as the Under-19 skipper, who led India to victory at the 2008 World Cup held in Malaysia. Virat is one of the finest fielders in an Indian side which needs more men like him to make up for the other abysmal ones.

He can also roll his arm over, with some occasional medium pace and has modelled his action on Chris Harris. Virat was made the captain of the Bangalore franchise in the Indian Premier League for the season 2013.

            He carried his great form into the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under, in which he smashed four hundreds in four Test matches.
